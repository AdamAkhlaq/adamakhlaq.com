instructions:
  - step: 1
    text: "Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat. Add the frozen onion and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes. Toss in the frozen garlic cubes and cook for another minute."
  - step: 2
    text: "Add the beef mince, breaking it apart as you go. Cook until nicely browned, then add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they've softened and released their moisture."
  - step: 3
    text: "Stir in the tomato purée and let it cook for a minute to caramelise slightly - this deepens the flavour."
  - step: 4
    text: "Crumble the beef stock cube directly into the pan. Add the chopped tomatoes, give everything a good stir, then reduce heat to low and let it simmer uncovered for 12-15 minutes, stirring occasionally."
    timer: 15
  - step: 5
    text: "While the sauce bubbles away, bring a pot of salted water to boil. Cook the spaghetti for 10-12 minutes until al dente. Before draining, reserve a splash of pasta water."
    timer: 12
  - step: 6
    text: "Taste the sauce and adjust seasoning with the salt, pepper, oregano, and basil. Toss the drained pasta in the sauce or serve with sauce spooned on top."
  - step: 7
    text: "Top each serving with grated Parmesan if you fancy it."
notes:
  - "Reserve a little pasta water to loosen the sauce if needed"
  - "Simmering the sauce longer will deepen the flavour"
